# Simple Guessing Game S

Using Javascript and prompt to make a simple ‘guessing’ game.
1. Users enter the maximum value i.e. 10
2. Users then guess what the random number generated is, with clues given i.e. "too high" or "too low"
3. At the end, it’ll tell you how long it took to guess correctly (in 'console.log')
